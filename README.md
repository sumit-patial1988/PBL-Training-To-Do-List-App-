### Day 4 – Can This Task Be Completed? Let’s Add Logic!
### 1. Main Project (PBL Context): Building a To-Do App with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Project Vision:
By the end of this project, learners will build a functional To-Do List application that:

Lets users add, delete, and mark tasks as completed

Uses JavaScript logic to manage task behavior

Supports a clean, responsive layout

Can later store tasks in browser memory or connect to back-end APIs

Today’s Focus: Implementing Conditional Statements in JavaScript to handle task states and user actions.

### 2. Today’s Problem Statement (PSBL)
Standard Problem Statement:
You're building a to-do list app. You want users to mark tasks as done, prevent empty tasks from being added, and delete tasks — but none of that logic is working yet.

Rewritten as User Stories:
As a user, I want to add a task only if I’ve written something.

As a user, I want completed tasks to be styled differently.

As a user, I want to delete a task when it’s no longer needed.

As a developer, I want to use conditional statements to control what happens based on user actions.

### 3. Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

Understand if, else if, and else statements in JavaScript.

Use conditionals to validate user input.

Toggle task status (completed vs. not completed).

Use conditions to show or hide different elements.

### 4. Scenario-Based Framing
Imagine you're interning at a small startup. Your manager wants a simple task list feature on the homepage. You’ve got the UI ready, but it doesn’t work yet. You must use logic to control how tasks behave based on user input.

You need to:

Prevent users from adding blank tasks.

Strike through completed tasks visually.

Remove tasks when users click delete.

### 5. Mini Visual Roadmap (Descriptive)
text
Copy
Edit
[Start]
   ↓
User types a task and clicks "Add"
   ↓
Check if input is not empty → Add to list
   ↓
User clicks checkbox → Mark as completed
   ↓
User clicks delete → Remove task
   ↓
[End]
### 6. Conceptual Explanation (Notes + Code Walkthroughs)
🔹 JavaScript Control Structures
if (condition) { ... }

else if (otherCondition) { ... }

else { ... }

🔹 Sample Logic for Task Addition
```
const taskInput = document.getElementById("taskInput");
const taskList = document.getElementById("taskList");

function addTask() {
  const taskText = taskInput.value.trim();
  
  if (taskText === "") {
    alert("Task cannot be empty!");
  } else {
    const li = document.createElement("li");
    li.textContent = taskText;
    taskList.appendChild(li);
    taskInput.value = "";
  }
} ```
🔹 Toggling Task Completion
```
li.addEventListener("click", function () {
  if (li.classList.contains("completed")) {
    li.classList.remove("completed");
  } else {
    li.classList.add("completed");
  }
}); ```
🔹 Deleting a Task
```
const deleteBtn = document.createElement("button");
deleteBtn.textContent = "❌";
deleteBtn.onclick = function () {
  li.remove();
};
li.appendChild(deleteBtn);
```
### 7. Hands-On Implementation (Code + Integration in Project)
🔸 Folder Structure:

/todo-app
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  └── script.js
🔸 index.html

<input id="taskInput" placeholder="Add a task" />
<button onclick="addTask()">Add</button>
<ul id="taskList"></ul>
🔸 style.css

.completed {
  text-decoration: line-through;
  color: grey;
}
🔸 script.js (logic with conditionals)
See snippets above for logic.

### 8. Output-Based Assessment (with GitHub Push)
✅ Task 1:
Only allow task addition if the input is not empty.

✅ Task 2:
Mark task as completed/uncompleted when clicked.

✅ Task 3:
Delete task when the ❌ button is clicked.

✅ Task 4:
Push project to GitHub with the message: "Implemented conditional logic for task operations".

### 9. Interview Preparation (5 Output-Based Qs)
Q1:
js
Copy
Edit
if ("") {
  console.log("Empty");
} else {
  console.log("Not Empty");
}
What will be printed?

a) Empty

b) Not Empty

c) undefined

d) Error

✅ Answer: b) Not Empty

Q2:
What does trim() do to a string?

a) Removes all letters

b) Converts to uppercase

c) Removes spaces from start and end

d) Makes string bold

✅ Answer: c) Removes spaces from start and end

Q3:
Which of these is a conditional operator?

a) =

b) ++

c) ==

d) !==

✅ Answer: d) !==

Q4:
What is the result of if (null)?

a) True

b) False

c) Error

d) Null

✅ Answer: b) False

Q5:
What happens if you try to access .value of a non-existent input element?

a) It returns null

b) It throws an error

c) It logs undefined

d) Nothing happens

✅ Answer: b) It throws an error

### 10. Connection to the Next Problem Statement
Next Up: Tasks are being added and toggled—but they disappear on page reload. Where do we store them?

📌 Next Session:
Problem: "Where Did My Tasks Go?"
You will learn:

How to use localStorage

Save tasks permanently

Load tasks on page refresh
